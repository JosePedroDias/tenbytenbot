# tenbytenbot

A bot to play the [tenbyten](https://github.com/JosePedroDias/tenbyten) game via its HTTP interface.
I'm making this project as a way of learning Clojure.



## Usage

    $ lein run



## Roadmap

* [x] porting whole tenbyten operations
* [x] make dumbest playing bot (random from valid moves)
* [x] compute board after lines have been removed
* [ ] **make bot elect moves based on 1 play heuristic (> number of empty cells; < number of islands)**
* [ ] make bot elect moves based on 3 plays heuristic
* [ ] make the bot enter highscores
